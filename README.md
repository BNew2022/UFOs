# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to build a website using HTML, JavaScript that allows users to search UFO sighting data based on date, location and shape.  We will customize the website using Bootstrap and use the D3 JS library to add functionality.

# Results
The website we built uses drop down menus to allow users to filter results using the following critera:

When we filter using one of the input boxes, we get all the results that match the input from the filter:

We can filter using one, some or all of the filters to get the results we are looking for.

# Summary
One of the drawbacks of the design as it doesn't allow us to filter by "Duration" or "Comments".  We could add a filter for "Duration" and "Comments" to make the site even more functional.  For the comments section we could use a wildcard search to pull up one or multiple words in the comments section if we wanted to dive deeper into the data and look for patterns within the comments.
